# Canada_Fed_Election_Results_2015
##Summary
The visualization compares the discrepency between percentage of votes and percentage of seats won in the latest Canadian federal election. Data was collected form Elections Canada website.

##Design
###Initial: 
The visualization consists of two graphs. On the first graph it shows percent of seats won by each political party. Y-axis encodes for percent of seats. X-axis encodes for political party. I've chosen for colour to encode for political party as well even though x-axis already encodes for it. This was done because each party has a certain colour associated to it, akin to a brand. This will make it easier for a person familiar with Canadian politics to quickly identify which bar represents which political party without having to read x-axis labels.

The second graph adds a new bar for each political bar. This new bar represents percentage of people that voted for that political party. Each bar is still coloured by party's brand colour but bars reprensenting percentage of votes are lighter coloured.

###First feedback update:
Since the second graph encompases data that is shown on the first graph, I've eliminated the first graph.

Moved the explanation text to the bottom of the bar graph.

##Feedback
###First feedback:
I notice there are two paragraphs before showing the graph. It is good to give some background information. Is it better to show the text below the graph? People may be at a loss in the first several seconds of viewing your visualization. They may just close it if they find it confusing.

On the axis, there is enought space for the text to be horizontal.

I notice generally speaking the higher percentage of votes means higher percentage of seats won.

The main takeway will be that "liberal" and "conservative" are the two major players in the election.

There is a lack of way to change between the two different graphs.
