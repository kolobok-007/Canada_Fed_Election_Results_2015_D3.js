# Canada_Fed_Election_Results_2016
##Summary
The visualization compares the discrepency between percentage of votes and percentage of seats won in the latest Canadian federal election. Data was collected form Elections Canada website.

##Design
Initial: 
The visualization consists of two graphs. On the first graph it shows percent of seats won by each political party. Y-axis encodes for percent of seats. X-axis encodes for political party. I've chosen for colour to encode for political party as well even though x-axis already encodes for it. This was done because each party has a certain colour associated to it, akin to a brand. This will make it easier for a person familiar with Canadian politics to quickly identify which bar represents which political party without having to read x-axis labels.

The second graph adds a new bar for each political bar. This new bar represents percentage of people that voted for that political party. Each bar is still coloured by party's brand colour but bars reprensenting percentage of votes are lighter coloured.
